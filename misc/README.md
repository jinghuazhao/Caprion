# Miscellaneous analysis

This directory is created to accommodate many largely independent jobs.

Due to somewhat generic nature, implementations might well cover both proteins and peptides.

## Analysis

- `csq.sh`. Consequences of variants.
- `deCODE_UKB_PPP.sh`. adaptation from tables() and extension from ?`pQTLtools::novelty_check()`.
- `eSet.sh`. ExpresssionSet implementations.
- `glmnet_pense.sh`. glmnet/pense modeling.
- `impute.sh`. imputation experiments.
- `tables.sh`. summary tables from `progs/0_utils.sh`.

## Legacy codes

- `0_compare.sb`. contrast with deCODE/UKB-PPP.
- `inf1.sh`. snapshot from SCALLOP/INF meta-analysis.
