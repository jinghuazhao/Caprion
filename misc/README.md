# Miscellaneous analysis

This section accommodates many largely independent tasks.

Implementation might well be generic so that both proteins and peptides are covered.

## Programs and applications

These are summarised in the following table,

Program   | Description
----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
`csq.sh` | Consequences of variants
`deCODE_UKB_PPP.sh` | deCODE?UKB-PPP replication
`eSet.sh` | ExpresssionSet implementations
`glmnet_pense.sh` | glmnet/pense modeling
`impute.sh` | imputation experiments
`json.sh` | Some notes on JSON files
`peptideAssociationPlot.sh` | protein Manhattan-peptide signal plots
`tables.sh` | `Supplementary-Tables.xlsx` generator
`ToDo.sh` | various staged experiments

## Legacy codes

- `0_compare.sb`. earlier contrast with deCODE/UKB-PPP.
- `inf1.sh`. snapshot from SCALLOP/INF meta-analysis.
