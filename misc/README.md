# Miscellaneous analysis

This directory is created to accommodate many largely independent tasks.

Due to their somewhat generic nature, implementations might well cover both proteins and peptides.

## Programs and their utilities

These are summarised in the following table,

Program   | Application
----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------
`csq.sh` | Consequences of variants
`deCODE_UKB_PPP.sh` | adaptation from `tables.sh` and ?`pQTLtools::novelty_check()`
`eSet.sh` | ExpresssionSet implementations
`glmnet_pense.sh` | glmnet/pense modeling
`impute.sh` | imputation experiments
`peptideAssociationPlot.sh` | protein Manhattan-peptide signal plots
`tables.sh` | `Supplementary-Tables.xlsx` generator
`ToDo.sh` | various experiments

## Legacy codes

- `0_compare.sb`. contrast with deCODE/UKB-PPP.
- `inf1.sh`. snapshot from SCALLOP/INF meta-analysis.
