Meta-data Isotope.Group.ID is a unique identifier for a group of isotopes that belong to the same peptide or molecule. In mass spectrometry, isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons. This ID helps to group together isotopes that arise from the same peptide, allowing for easier identification and analysis. Protein contains the name or identifier of the protein that the peptide (or molecule) is derived from. This information is typically obtained by searching the MS data against a protein database. Modified.Peptide.Sequence is the amino acid sequence of the peptide, including any post-translational modifications (PTMs) that have been identified. PTMs are chemical modifications that occur after protein synthesis, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or methylation. The sequence is usually represented in a standard format, such as using lowercase letters for modified residues. Monoisotopic.m/z is the monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the peptide or molecule. The monoisotopic mass is the mass of the most abundant isotope of each element in the molecule, which is typically the lightest isotope (e.g., 12C, 1H, 14N, 16O, etc.). This value is used as a reference point for identifying the peptide or molecule. Max.Isotope.Time.Centroid is the time centroid (or apex) of the most intense isotope in the isotope group. In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), peptides are separated based on their retention time (the time it takes for the peptide to elute from the column). The time centroid is the time point at which the peptide signal is most intense, which can be used to quantify the peptide abundance. Charge is the charge state of the peptide or molecule. In mass spectrometry, peptides can be ionized to different charge states (e.g., +1, +2, +3, etc.), which affects their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The charge state is an important parameter for identifying peptides and molecules. They are invaluable for analyzing and interpreting MS data, including peptide identification, quantification, and characterization of post-translational modifications. II. MS1/MS2 In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the typical workflow for identifying peptides and proteins involves using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2). In this process, precursor ions (peptides) are selected in the first stage of mass spectrometry (MS1) and then fragmented to produce a series of smaller ions in the second stage (MS2). The resulting fragment ions (product ions) are analyzed to infer the sequence of the peptide and, by extension, identify the proteins from which they were derived. However, it is possible to infer peptides and proteins using only MS1 data through a process known as \"MS1-only\" or \"untargeted\" analysis. This approach can be particularly useful in the following scenarios: Label-based quantification : Techniques like SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) or chemical labeling (e.g., TMT, iTRAQ) rely on MS1 data for quantification. The mass shift introduced by labels allows for the direct comparison of peptide abundances based on their MS1 ion intensities. Label-free quantification : Proteins can be quantified by comparing the intensities of their corresponding peptide ions in MS1 across different samples. This requires accurate mass and retention time alignment and often uses algorithms to detect and quantify features (peptide ions) consistently across multiple runs. Accurate Mass and Time tags (AMT) : This approach relies on a previously established library of peptide identifications, where each peptide is characterized by its accurate mass and normalized retention time. In subsequent analyses, peptides can be inferred by matching the observed accurate mass and retention time to the library without the need for MS2 fragmentation. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) : In some DIA workflows, proteins can be inferred from MS1 data when coupled with complex data analysis strategies and spectral libraries. It is important to note that while DIA collects MS1 spectra, it also involves the simultaneous fragmentation of all ions in a given mass range, and thus MS2-level data is typically available and used for identification. It is important to note that MS1-only approaches may have limitations in terms of identification specificity and sensitivity compared to traditional MS2-based methods. MS1-based protein inference is generally less confident because it lacks sequence-specific information that can only be obtained from fragment ions in MS2. For this reason, MS1-based methods are often complemented by MS2 data or rely on extensive peptide libraries and sophisticated computational algorithms to increase the confidence of peptide and protein identification.

Proteoform Analysis ETH Zurich, U Toronto Team Develops Tool for Bottom-Up Proteomics Proteoform Analysis Jul 28, 2021 | Adam Bonislawski NEW YORK \u2013 A team led by researchers at ETH Zurich and the University of Toronto has developed a tool that allows for the detection of protein proteoforms in bottom-up proteomics data. Described in a paper published in June in Nature Communications, the tool, called COPF (COrrelation-based functional ProteoForm) uses peptide correlation analysis to detect differences in proteoform populations across different samples or conditions and could aid researchers as they seek to better understand the role different protein forms play in biology and disease. The human genome is thought to have around 20,000 protein coding genes, but many of these 20,000 proteins exist in the body in various forms, differentiated by, for instance, post-translational modifications or amino acid substitutions. These different forms are called proteoforms, and it is widely believed that biological processes are guided not just by the proteins present but by what proteoforms are present and in what proportions. Traditional bottom-up proteomics workflows have provided only limited insight into proteoform populations however, due to the fact that the presence of a particular protein is typically inferred by the detection of just a few of its peptides and that digesting proteins into peptides for mass spec analysis makes it near impossible to link a modified peptide back to a particular proteoform. Some proteomics researchers have addressed this issue by moving to top-down proteomics, which looks at intact proteins, allowing them to better distinguish between different proteoforms. Top-down proteomics is very technically challenging, however, and is not yet able to analyze proteins with the breadth and depth of bottom-up workflows. Recently, the development of more reproducible and higher-throughput bottom-up workflows, and particular workflows using data independent-acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry, have allowed researchers like the Nature Communications authors to apply peptide correlation analysis to the study of proteoforms. Peptide correlation analysis looks at differences in peptide behavior within and across proteins in bottom-up data. Researchers have developed a number of approaches for turning peptide measurements into protein data, with most working under the assumption that peptides from the same protein will behave the same way. In practice, though, that isn't the case. On one hand, there are a number of technical reasons why two peptides from the same protein may not behave the same way. For instance, different digestion efficiencies could lead to some peptides being more abundant than others. Different ionization efficiencies could similarly make one peptide more likely than another to be detected by the mass spec. The presence of different proteoforms could also play a role. For instance, if a protein is present in both a full-length and truncated form, expression changes observed in the full-length form wouldn't be observable if the peptide being measured wasn't present in the truncated form. Not only would this throw off protein-level quantitation, but it would also mask relative changes in the two protein forms that could be biologically important. A major challenge to applying this insight has been determining which differences in peptide behavior reflect real technical or biological variation and which are just noise, noted Hannes R\u00f6st, research chair in mass spectrometry-based personalized medicine at the University of Toronto and an author on the Nature Communications study. \"In many cases [such variation] was noise,\" he said. \"When you look at traditional shotgun proteomics workflows and data analyses, really the power is not at the peptide-level quantification but at the protein level from the aggregation of multiple peptides. On the peptide level you see a lot of noise, and I think that has prevented us from using this observation that individual peptides could yield a lot of interested information because people really only looked at the protein-level data, because that is what they trusted.\" R\u00f6st said that the development of targeted protein quantitation approaches like multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) has demonstrated that individual peptides can be measured with high accuracy, and the development of DIA mass spec approaches has enabled MRM-style peptide quantitation at the proteome scale. At the same time, improvements in mass spec technology have allowed researchers to collect the kind of large and reproducible datasets required for peptide correlation analysis, he said. \"These are types of experiments we wouldn't have imagined 10 years ago, because for correlation-based approaches to work, you need a relatively large number of samples, and you need low variance,\" he said. \"We are not detecting [proteoforms] that are not changing between different [conditions], we are only detecting those that change. And for this to work we need to have multiple replicates and we need to have different conditions and to be able to measure these peptides with high quantitative accuracy across these conditions.\" The COPF tool looks at the intensities of peptides coming from a particular protein across all the samples measured in an experiment and then calculates peptide correlations for all the pairs of peptides coming from that protein and uses hierarchical clustering to divide the peptides into two clusters. It then scores the likelihood that multiple proteoforms of a protein are present by comparing the level of peptide correlation between the clusters to the level of in-cluster variation. The tool does not identify the specific modifications or variations that distinguish the different proteoforms but rather the peptides that appear to differentiate between the forms of the protein in the different biological contexts investigated. Analyzing a DIA dataset that looked at five different tissue types across eight different mice, COPF identified 63 proteins that exhibited different proteoform groups, including proteins with known tissue-specific splice variants. The researchers also identified proteoforms created by proteolytic and autocatalytic cleavage and phosphorylation, indicating, they wrote, that the tool is \"agnostic to the different mechanisms by which proteoforms can be generated inside the cell.\" The development of COPF follows the publication last year of a study by researchers at Barts Cancer Institute and the University of Wisconsin-Madison detailing another peptide correlation analysis tool for identifying proteoforms in bottom-up data called PeCorA. Unlike COPF, which requires proteoforms to differ by two or more peptides, PeCorA can detect proteoforms based on single peptide differences. This makes it a potentially more sensitive tool but also less specific than COPF, R\u00f6st said. More generally, he said that he expected ongoing improvements in mass spec technology would further improve peptide correlation-based approaches like COPF and PeCorA by boosting peptide coverage. \"To kind of cover every possible protein isoform we would need to have complete coverage of every protein, and unfortunately we are currently quite far away from having peptide-level coverage of every protein,\" he said. \"I think that is currently one of the limitations where we are kind of hitting a wall.\" R\u00f6st added that his lab has begun acquiring data on Bruker's timsTOF Pro platform, \"and there we definitely see both an increase in protein coverage and also in the number of peptides we can measure.\" \"That's why I'm very optimistic that while this is just the first implementation of the method, the data we are producing at this moment is much more complete, and therefore I think it would be even more suitable to our approach than the data we used in the paper,\" he said.","title":"Notes"},{"location":"pilot/Notes/#notes","text":"( Sections I -- III are due to Claude )","title":"Notes"},{"location":"pilot/Notes/#i-meta-data","text":"Isotope.Group.ID is a unique identifier for a group of isotopes that belong to the same peptide or molecule. In mass spectrometry, isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but differ in the number of neutrons. This ID helps to group together isotopes that arise from the same peptide, allowing for easier identification and analysis. Protein contains the name or identifier of the protein that the peptide (or molecule) is derived from. This information is typically obtained by searching the MS data against a protein database. Modified.Peptide.Sequence is the amino acid sequence of the peptide, including any post-translational modifications (PTMs) that have been identified. PTMs are chemical modifications that occur after protein synthesis, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or methylation. The sequence is usually represented in a standard format, such as using lowercase letters for modified residues. Monoisotopic.m/z is the monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the peptide or molecule. The monoisotopic mass is the mass of the most abundant isotope of each element in the molecule, which is typically the lightest isotope (e.g., 12C, 1H, 14N, 16O, etc.). This value is used as a reference point for identifying the peptide or molecule. Max.Isotope.Time.Centroid is the time centroid (or apex) of the most intense isotope in the isotope group. In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), peptides are separated based on their retention time (the time it takes for the peptide to elute from the column). The time centroid is the time point at which the peptide signal is most intense, which can be used to quantify the peptide abundance. Charge is the charge state of the peptide or molecule. In mass spectrometry, peptides can be ionized to different charge states (e.g., +1, +2, +3, etc.), which affects their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The charge state is an important parameter for identifying peptides and molecules. They are invaluable for analyzing and interpreting MS data, including peptide identification, quantification, and characterization of post-translational modifications.","title":"I. Meta-data"},{"location":"pilot/Notes/#ii-ms1ms2","text":"In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the typical workflow for identifying peptides and proteins involves using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS2). In this process, precursor ions (peptides) are selected in the first stage of mass spectrometry (MS1) and then fragmented to produce a series of smaller ions in the second stage (MS2). The resulting fragment ions (product ions) are analyzed to infer the sequence of the peptide and, by extension, identify the proteins from which they were derived. However, it is possible to infer peptides and proteins using only MS1 data through a process known as \"MS1-only\" or \"untargeted\" analysis. This approach can be particularly useful in the following scenarios: Label-based quantification : Techniques like SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) or chemical labeling (e.g., TMT, iTRAQ) rely on MS1 data for quantification. The mass shift introduced by labels allows for the direct comparison of peptide abundances based on their MS1 ion intensities. Label-free quantification : Proteins can be quantified by comparing the intensities of their corresponding peptide ions in MS1 across different samples. This requires accurate mass and retention time alignment and often uses algorithms to detect and quantify features (peptide ions) consistently across multiple runs. Accurate Mass and Time tags (AMT) : This approach relies on a previously established library of peptide identifications, where each peptide is characterized by its accurate mass and normalized retention time. In subsequent analyses, peptides can be inferred by matching the observed accurate mass and retention time to the library without the need for MS2 fragmentation. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) : In some DIA workflows, proteins can be inferred from MS1 data when coupled with complex data analysis strategies and spectral libraries. It is important to note that while DIA collects MS1 spectra, it also involves the simultaneous fragmentation of all ions in a given mass range, and thus MS2-level data is typically available and used for identification. It is important to note that MS1-only approaches may have limitations in terms of identification specificity and sensitivity compared to traditional MS2-based methods. MS1-based protein inference is generally less confident because it lacks sequence-specific information that can only be obtained from fragment ions in MS2. For this reason, MS1-based methods are often complemented by MS2 data or rely on extensive peptide libraries and sophisticated computational algorithms to increase the confidence of peptide and protein identification.","title":"II.

Note also that HetISq() only works inside an interactive R session. 1. Data handling and PCA projection The pipeline follows HGI contributions nevertheless only serves for reassurance since the study samples were carefully selected. 2. GGM The results are ready to report. 3. WGCNA This can be finalised according to the Science paper. 4. PCA and clustering The groupings based on unfiltered and DR-filtered proteins can be made on three phases altogether and instead of a classification indicator the first three PCs are used. The PLINK2 has been used in the pilot studies, but now fastGWA using double transformations of the phenotypic data similar to SCALLOP-Seq analysis. Amazingly, a standard assignment statement inside sapply() would produce .pheno / .mpheno containing the raw data. The file also includes experiments on normalisation. 5. pGWAS 3 The bgen files were extracted from a list of all samples, the variant IDs of which were for all RSids to allow for multiallelic loci. The (sb)atch file is extended to produce Q-Q/Manhattan/LocusZoom plots and extreme p values are possible for all plots. Note that LocusZoom 1.4 does not contain 1000Genomes build 37 genotypes for chromosome X and therefore they are supplemented with local files in the required format, namely, locuszoom_1.4/data/1000G/genotypes/2014-10-14/EUR/chrX.[bed, bim, fan] . Now that for the Manhattan plot call for VEP is necessary from 0_utils.sb , which also produces mean by genotype/dosage plots. 6. Meta-analysis Internally, this follows from the SCALLOP/INF implementation, as designed analogous to a Makefile, i.e., 6_meta_analysis <task> where task = METAL_list, METAL_files, METAL_analysis, respectively in sequence. However, due to time limit on HPC, a call to .sb is made for meta-analysis. To extract significant variants one may resort to awk 'NR==1||$12<log(1e-6)/log(10)' 1433B-1.tbl , say. 7. Variant identification An iterative merging scheme is employed; the HLA region is simplified but will be specifically handled. Somewhat paradoxically, forest plots are also obtained here 4 . A SLURM job is executed, to be followed by collection of results. 8. HLA imputation 5 This is experimented on several software including HIBAG, CookHLA and SNP2HLA as desribed here . The whole cohort imputation requests resources exceeding the system limits, so a cardio SLURM job is used instead. The hped file from CookHLA (or converted from HIBAG) can be used by HATK for association analysis while the advantage of SNP2HLA is that binary ped files are ready for use as usual. 9.

A few things that we need to tidy up: Rare variants -- it looks like there are some rare variant false positives, so I suggest we impose a MAF threshold of 1%. I would calculate this once for each variant across all the batches and then either include/exclude that variant from the meta-analysis results (i.e., rather than having a variant that has MAF=0.9% excluded from one batch and then that variant gets included in a batch where it has MAF=1.1%, we just include the variant if it has overall MAF>=1% and drop it if it has overall MAF<1%); does that make sense? As data for each batch arrived earlier, an MAF>=1% threshold was set in the association analysis; recently this has been raised to 1/1,000 (56%) - the major consideration is the number of variants increases substantially (~80M) there the diskspace where most does not contribute meaningful results. In fact the last DR filtered results appeared to have less heterogeneity with an overall cutoff. QC sanity checks -- to see why some of these rare variants are coming up and whether this suggests any issues with our phenotypes, it would also be good to plot the phenotype distributions by genotype (i.e., box plots) for some of these rare variant associations to see what is going on Results shown earlier used a cutoff of 0.001 and would improved with 0.01 (now only rs74854424 for MXRA5, -log10(P)=7.59). Mean-by-genotype box plots have been drawn before and repeated for all pQTLs, see /rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-projects/Caprion_proteomics/analysis/pgwas_dr/means [also pgwas/means]. Cis vs trans -- I think it would also be useful to mark on the plots somehow which are cis vs trans, as the gene name and protein name are not always the same so it\\'s hard to know for sure from the plots if they are cis or trans signals. It will also be useful to see if there are any likely true positives among the rare variant signals that we are going to exclude Done Manhattan plot by colouring, and forest/locuszoom (1000Genomes reference panel) plots by labelling. LD colouring -- it looks like the LD colouring does not work for some plots, particularly where the lead variant is an indel (e.g., 1433F [1:57382718 (rs142885967) (CTG/C) N=2491]) but not always only for indels (e.g., 6PGD [2:121896327 (rs7571988) (A/G) N=2491]). Please could you fix this? This is largely fixed with the INTERVAL reference panel except just over a dozen - the reason being that LocusZoom uses chr:pos instead of rsid for variant id. Missing participants -- most have variants have ZWK=200 people, ZYQ=748 people, UDP=1543 people, but there are some who have fewer (e.g., 1433S [7:61244066 (rs57315688) (A/C) N=1684]). Could you remind me why this happens? This was cut down by missing phenotypes when running GCTA/fastGWA (/rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-projects/Caprion_proteomics//analysis/pgwas_dr/slurm/_pgwas_fastLR_25014077_5.o, a rounding up in the forest plot): ZWK=135, ZYQ=1049, UDP=500. An alternative approach to check via LocusZoom.js is here, https://jhz22.user.srcf.net/Caprion/dr/1433S.htm NB - on this last example, the LZ plot also looks odd; is it just a strange genetic region? A comparison has been made using 1000G and INTERVAL which are similar, so this is one of those strange regions. Comparing the unfiltered vs DR -- at the moment it\\'s hard to compare the unfiltered results vs the DR filtered results systematically as they are in different files. Could you take all the lead SNPs from both the unfiltered and the DR filtered and make a beta-beta plot across all proteins? That way we will be able to see if there is a systematic signal strength difference. (We may also need a -log10p vs -log10p plot too). It would also help to make a Venn diagram of how many cis / trans signals are seen only in unfiltered, how many are seen only in DR filtered, and how many are seen in both. The unfiltered/DR results were broadly similar, as shown in the presentation. We look forward to extensive results from Xiyun/Technopole.

A benchmark is needed otherwise: Suhre et al. (2023) bioRxiv shows cis-pQTL rs893184 (19:58864479:T:C) involving peptide LETPDFQLFK. 29/3/2023 The experiment trails the original benchmark, ZWK, ZYQ and UDP for 18,947, 20,525 and 17,876 isotope groups, respectively. The peptides are 7,152, 7,934, 6,984, only partially annotated by PoGo -- 168 more in ZWK than UDP, 782 more in ZYQ than ZWK or 950 than UDP. To allow for 1 mismatch (-mm 1), the ZWK, ZYQ, UDP then are associated with 18,864, 30,042 and 22,146 entries, respectively. Tromso study Association results were obtained both with respect to proteins and peptides, their LDs examined (ST3), and identification of artefact (ST4). Rare variants can also be identified through burden tests, in particular on peptides (ST6) using MAF, deleterious, CADD criteria (possibly SCALLOP-Seq?). The A1BG protein showing significance on rare variants (ST5) appears both on TMT and Caprion platforms. Algorithms were devised to examine artefact through missense variants and to detect putative function variants (PFV) using HaploReg/SNPEff, followed by curation so that LD(r2) can be examined with sentinel.

Q3. make heatmaps to visualise the correlations. Check how you got the conclusion for the Weight part of the answer from the results that you show (i.e. for the Distance analysis the ZYQ-UDP value is different from the other 2 values suggesting that ZWQ is the 'odd batch out', but for the Weight analysis the ZWK-ZYQ value is different from the other 2 values, so shouldn't UDP be the 'odd batch out'?) The following is intensity correlations by batch. The following is peptide correlations by batch. There has been observation that the correlations of log2-scaled values are down, see https://www.biostars.org/p/13181/ . New Q3b: are the between-peptide correlations higher where the peptides have identical values of the Modified.Peptide.Sequence, compared to peptides that have different values of Modified.Peptide.Sequence? This is the case according to the heatmaps above. Q4. explore why none of the values in the tables match the results of Q3 - what is the difference? Check why results for (e) and (f) are identical Correlations for (e) and (f) will differ when condition used in (f) becomes effective. Q5. protein-level: just use one SNP to represent each region and put values for protein_all and protein_DRfilt side-by-side in a table so we can easily compare them visually. Would be good to also do a beta-beta and -log10P-log10P plot to see if there are systematic differences in beta or P-value for _all vs _DRfilt.

Superficially, the breakdown are the same (as in the table below) according to annotation files. In reality, this is not the case (see item 2). EPCR_HUMAN ERAP2_HUMAN PROC_HUMAN 4 9 31 Note there are ZWK-labelled peptides 2 in all three batches and XCC codes 3 in ZYQ and UDP. Are the same peptides used to quantify each protein across all 3 batches? i.e. do the same subset of peptides pass the detection rate filter (at least 10% of the samples have a raw intensity above 50,000) for each protein in each batch? Not quite and they are protein-specific - this is in terms of two aspects: Isotope group ID appearances: ZWK: all 44 isotope group IDs appear in ZWK ZYQ: is missing for ERAP2 (442660495) UDP: is missing for PROC (442616032, 442686905) and ERAP2 (442660495). At 10% detection rate: ZWK: four for PROC ZYQ: additional two isotope groups (442615094, 442732013) do not have data for ERAP2, six (442607670, 442611348, 442616032, 442686905, 442739582, 442847259) for PROC. UDP: no isotope groups (442615094, 442640156, 442732013 for ERAP2, 442590967, 442607670, 442611348, 442662841, 442739582 for PROC) and one (442847259 for PROC) below the detection rate. Does the between-peptide (and peptide-protein) correlation structure differ between the batches? i.e. for the same pair of peptides, is the correlation coefficient similar across the 3 batches? The distance is measured by \\(d(x,y)=||x-y||_1\\) the sum of absolute pairwise differences ( \\(L_1\\) -norm) in \\(R(r^2)\\) between batches, such that \\(d(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{ZYQ})\\) =232.69, \\(d(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =238.59 and \\(d(R(r^2)_{ZYQ},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =118.74 ( values to be updated ), where \\(R(r^2)\\) is \\(N\\times N\\) matrix of squared correlation coefficients. Therefore there are more similarity between ZYQ and UDP. Note this is based on 3 proteins and 38 peptides common to all three batches. We can also obtain \\(w(R(r^2))=\\sum R(r^2)-N\\) as a totality measure of \\(N(N-1)\\) pairs of correlations, or their mean, doubling their actual values due to symmetry. \\(w(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{ZYQ})\\) =127.36, \\(w(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =216.67, \\(w(R(r^2)_{ZYQ},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =219.21. This again shows that ZWK is less correlated than ZYQ and UDP which are similar. Does the between-peptide correlation structure differ if using (a) the raw values, (b) the raw values excluding any values equal to zero, (c) the raw values excluding any values below 50,000, (d) the normalized peptide values, (e) the normalized peptide values excluding any samples where the raw value was equal to zero, (f) the normalized peptide values excluding any samples where the raw value was below 50,000? As expected, the differences in correlation patterns are slightly larger nevertheless the same order of magnitude.

A. How often does a different identified peptide have exactly the same amino acid sequence? E.g. within the 19,652 Isotope Group IDs in the first batch of data (\u2018ZWK\u2019), what is the distribution of identical peptides (i.e. what proportion are unique peptide sequences, what proportion are duplicates, what proportion are triplicates etc)? B. Where the modified peptide sequence has an alternative mass in square brackets (e.g. \u201cN[115.0269]\u201d), is the mass value always the same for each amino acid? i.e. does N always have 115.0269, does M always have 147.0354 etc? 2/11/2022 ~25k peptides + pQTLs are subject to further investigation. 15/9/2022 1+2+3 vs 2+3 Signal comparisons -- meta-analyses are done but are subject to compare. \\(I^2\\) comparisons stepwise regression, LD exploitation - it turns out that a larger INTERVAL reference (N=4,992) produces considerably more reasonable conditional signals than those based on the Caprion samples only. .badsnps [1] \"ZWK020105_1\" \"ZWK020105_2\" \"ZWK020105_3\" \"ZWK020105_4\" \"ZWK020112_1\" \"ZWK020112_2\" \"ZWK020112_3a\" \"ZWK020112_4\" \"ZWK020119_1\" \"ZWK020119_2\" \"ZWK020119_3\" \"ZWK020123_1\" \"ZWK020123_2\" [14] \"ZWK020123_3\" \"ZWK020123_4\" \"ZWK020102_1\" \"ZWK020102_2\" \"ZWK020102_3\" \"ZWK020102_4\" \"ZWK020110_1\" \"ZWK020110_2\" Notes on peptides and R objects Peptides ZWK.

A few things that we need to tidy up: Rare variants -- it looks like there are some rare variant false positives, so I suggest we impose a MAF threshold of 1%. I would calculate this once for each variant across all the batches and then either include/exclude that variant from the meta-analysis results (i.e., rather than having a variant that has MAF=0.9% excluded from one batch and then that variant gets included in a batch where it has MAF=1.1%, we just include the variant if it has overall MAF>=1% and drop it if it has overall MAF<1%); does that make sense? As data for each batch arrived earlier, an MAF>=1% threshold was set in the association analysis; recently this has been raised to 1/1,000 (56%) - the major consideration is the number of variants increases substantially (~80M) there the diskspace where most does not contribute meaningful results. In fact the last DR filtered results appeared to have less heterogeneity with an overall cutoff. QC sanity checks -- to see why some of these rare variants are coming up and whether this suggests any issues with our phenotypes, it would also be good to plot the phenotype distributions by genotype (i.e., box plots) for some of these rare variant associations to see what is going on Results shown earlier used a cutoff of 0.001 and would improved with 0.01 (now only rs74854424 for MXRA5, -log10(P)=7.59). Mean-by-genotype box plots have been drawn before and repeated for all pQTLs, see /rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-projects/Caprion_proteomics/analysis/pgwas_dr/means [also pgwas/means]. Cis vs trans -- I think it would also be useful to mark on the plots somehow which are cis vs trans, as the gene name and protein name are not always the same so it\\'s hard to know for sure from the plots if they are cis or trans signals. It will also be useful to see if there are any likely true positives among the rare variant signals that we are going to exclude Done Manhattan plot by colouring, and forest/locuszoom (1000Genomes reference panel) plots by labelling. LD colouring -- it looks like the LD colouring does not work for some plots, particularly where the lead variant is an indel (e.g., 1433F [1:57382718 (rs142885967) (CTG/C) N=2491]) but not always only for indels (e.g., 6PGD [2:121896327 (rs7571988) (A/G) N=2491]). Please could you fix this? This is largely fixed with the INTERVAL reference panel except just over a dozen - the reason being that LocusZoom uses chr:pos instead of rsid for variant id. Missing participants -- most have variants have ZWK=200 people, ZYQ=748 people, UDP=1543 people, but there are some who have fewer (e.g., 1433S [7:61244066 (rs57315688) (A/C) N=1684]). Could you remind me why this happens? This was cut down by missing phenotypes when running GCTA/fastGWA (/rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-projects/Caprion_proteomics//analysis/pgwas_dr/slurm/_pgwas_fastLR_25014077_5.o, a rounding up in the forest plot): ZWK=135, ZYQ=1049, UDP=500. An alternative approach to check via LocusZoom.js is here, https://jhz22.user.srcf.net/Caprion/dr/1433S.htm NB - on this last example, the LZ plot also looks odd; is it just a strange genetic region? A comparison has been made using 1000G and INTERVAL which are similar, so this is one of those strange regions. Comparing the unfiltered vs DR -- at the moment it\\'s hard to compare the unfiltered results vs the DR filtered results systematically as they are in different files. Could you take all the lead SNPs from both the unfiltered and the DR filtered and make a beta-beta plot across all proteins? That way we will be able to see if there is a systematic signal strength difference. (We may also need a -log10p vs -log10p plot too). It would also help to make a Venn diagram of how many cis / trans signals are seen only in unfiltered, how many are seen only in DR filtered, and how many are seen in both. The unfiltered/DR results were broadly similar, as shown in the presentation. We look forward to extensive results from Xiyun/Technopole.

The following is intensity correlations by batch. The following is peptide correlations by batch. There has been observation that the correlations of log2-scaled values are down, see https://www.biostars.org/p/13181/ . New Q3b: are the between-peptide correlations higher where the peptides have identical values of the Modified.Peptide.Sequence, compared to peptides that have different values of Modified.Peptide.Sequence? This is the case according to the heatmaps above. Q4. explore why none of the values in the tables match the results of Q3 - what is the difference? Check why results for (e) and (f) are identical Correlations for (e) and (f) will differ when condition used in (f) becomes effective. Q5. protein-level: just use one SNP to represent each region and put values for protein_all and protein_DRfilt side-by-side in a table so we can easily compare them visually. Would be good to also do a beta-beta and -log10P-log10P plot to see if there are systematic differences in beta or P-value for _all vs _DRfilt. You could do this for each batch of samples too, extending from the single batch you have looked at so far. The results involve PROC and EPCR for ZYQ with somewhat smaller P values for DR.

Superficially, the breakdown are the same (as in the table below) according to annotation files. In reality, this is not the case (see item 2). EPCR_HUMAN ERAP2_HUMAN PROC_HUMAN 4 9 31 Note there are ZWK-labelled peptides 2 in all three batches and XCC codes 3 in ZYQ and UDP. Are the same peptides used to quantify each protein across all 3 batches? i.e. do the same subset of peptides pass the detection rate filter (at least 10% of the samples have a raw intensity above 50,000) for each protein in each batch? Not quite and they are protein-specific - this is in terms of two aspects: Isotope group ID appearances: ZWK: all 44 isotope group IDs appear in ZWK ZYQ: is missing for ERAP2 (442660495) UDP: is missing for PROC (442616032, 442686905) and ERAP2 (442660495). At 10% detection rate: ZWK: four for PROC ZYQ: additional two isotope groups (442615094, 442732013) do not have data for ERAP2, six (442607670, 442611348, 442616032, 442686905, 442739582, 442847259) for PROC. UDP: no isotope groups (442615094, 442640156, 442732013 for ERAP2, 442590967, 442607670, 442611348, 442662841, 442739582 for PROC) and one (442847259 for PROC) below the detection rate. Does the between-peptide (and peptide-protein) correlation structure differ between the batches? i.e. for the same pair of peptides, is the correlation coefficient similar across the 3 batches? The distance is measured by \\(d(x,y)=||x-y||_1\\) the sum of absolute pairwise differences ( \\(L_1\\) -norm) in \\(R(r^2)\\) between batches, such that \\(d(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{ZYQ})\\) =232.69, \\(d(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =238.59 and \\(d(R(r^2)_{ZYQ},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =118.74 ( values to be updated ), where \\(R(r^2)\\) is \\(N\\times N\\) matrix of squared correlation coefficients. Therefore there are more similarity between ZYQ and UDP. Note this is based on 3 proteins and 38 peptides common to all three batches. We can also obtain \\(w(R(r^2))=\\sum R(r^2)-N\\) as a totality measure of \\(N(N-1)\\) pairs of correlations, or their mean, doubling their actual values due to symmetry. \\(w(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{ZYQ})\\) =127.36, \\(w(R(r^2)_{ZWK},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =216.67, \\(w(R(r^2)_{ZYQ},R(r^2)_{UDP})\\) =219.21. This again shows that ZWK is less correlated than ZYQ and UDP which are similar. Does the between-peptide correlation structure differ if using (a) the raw values, (b) the raw values excluding any values equal to zero, (c) the raw values excluding any values below 50,000, (d) the normalized peptide values, (e) the normalized peptide values excluding any samples where the raw value was equal to zero, (f) the normalized peptide values excluding any samples where the raw value was below 50,000? As expected, the differences in correlation patterns are slightly larger nevertheless the same order of magnitude.
